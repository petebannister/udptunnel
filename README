Pete Bannister: Forked code to make this cross platform and compilable on Windows.
Added CMake build also (required for Windows build).

Added experimental bound mode to enable this tunnel to act as a proxy over NAT where 
UDP hole punching doesn't work properly.  Warning: this is highly insecure and should 
never be used in web-facing environment!

The idea was to be able to tunnel UDP over TCP for Docker Linux containers on Windows.

UDPTunnel is a small program which can tunnel UDP packets bi-directionally
over a TCP connection.  Its primary purpose (and original motivation) is to
allow multi-media conferences to traverse a firewall which allows only
outgoing TCP connections.

Source code for Unix is available from
